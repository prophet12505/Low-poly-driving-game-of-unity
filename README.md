## a low-poly style driving game
I developed a low-poly style driving game using Unity, which features a variety of interactive map objects to enhance the gameplay experience.  

The game includes a selection of vehicles like trucks and trailers, as well as environmental elements such as cacti, rocks, fences, and gas stations.    

To enrich the user experience, I added obstacles and prize elements to the desert scene.    

For the vehicle's movement and functionality, I applied C# scripts that enable the vehicle to move forward and backward, turn left and right using default input keys, and feature a switchable camera allowing the player to switch from an overhead view to the 'driver's seat'.    

Additionally, I implemented functionality to restart the scene without requiring the player to stop and restart the game.
